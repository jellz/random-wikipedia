# random-wikipedia
Chrome extension for Wikipedia randomness

This extension contains:
- a button that opens a random Wikipedia article on-demand; and
- an feature that, if enabled, will open a random Wikipedia article at a random interval.

**This extension is not currently available on the Chrome Web Store so you'll need to load it as an unpacked extension.**

**Have feedback or need support?** Make an issue [over here](https://github.com/jellz/random-wikipedia/issues).
